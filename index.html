                <h2>Impact animal extinction can have on ecosystems<sup><a href="">1</a></sup></h2>
                <p>Animal extinction has widespread cascading effects for any ecosystem the extinct organism inhabited.
                    Losing an organism, whether it be plant life or animal life, has an effect on all other organisms
                    that have any amount of contact with the extinct organism, whether it be direct or indirect contact.
                    Extinction is a natural occurrence, in fact 99% of all species that ever existed are now extinct.
                    However; the rate of which species are going extinct is and has been accelerating at an alarming
                    rate due to human activity.<sup><a

                </p>
                <p>This site breifly focuses on a few endangered species of big cat, but these four species aren't even
                    a drop in the bucket compared to the tens of thousands of currently endangered species, if you would
                    like to read more you can find information <a

                <div class="text-align">
                    <p>Scientist estimate that between 150-200 species go extinct every 24 hours. <br> <button

                    <p class="note">*Estimating the true rate of daily extinction is difficult and there are many

                </h3>
                <p>There are over 37,400 species in danger of extinction according to <a

                <h3>Effects of over-hunting<sup><a

                </h3>
                <p>A well known example of the effects of over-hunting are the wolves of Yellowstone Park who were
                    hunted to near-extinction by the year 1930. With the wolves nearly wiped out the prey animals, such
                    as deer, were able to thrive and multiplied rapidly. The increased number of deer and elk were able
                    to ravage the native plant species which were home to many song birds, which continued on a chain
                    reaction allowing pesty insects like mosquitoes (which the birds would have normally eaten) to over
                    run the park.</p>
