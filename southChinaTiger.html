                <p>The south china tiger is native to region of South China, primarily the provinces Fujian, Guangdong,
                    Hunan, and Jiangxi. This species of tiger is critically endangered and has been labled so by the
                    IUCN Red List since 1996. The South China Tiger is believed to extinct in the wild because no wild
                    specimen has been recorded since the 1980s. <sup><a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_tiger">1</a></sup></p>
                <p>Many forces were at play that made the survival of these tigers extremely unlikely. These pressures
                    include but are not limited to; low prey density, widespread habitat degradation & fragmentation, as
                    well as other human pressures. <sup><a

                <h2>False Claims</h2>
                <p>In 2017, a villager from Shaanxi province in China claimed to have captures in excess of 30 digital
                    images of
                    a South China Tiger in the wild. This claim was immediately supported by the Shaanxi Provincial
                    Forestry Bureau in a press conference following the claim. However, many people doubted the
                    authenticity of the images and suspected that they were fake photographs. In the following year,
                    2008, the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau released a public apology for backing the images
                    without performing their due diligence as authorites announced that all 30+ pictures were proved to
                    be forged.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_tiger">1</a></sup></p>

                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_tiger">1</a></sup> </h3>
                <p>As of 2019, there are about 150 South China tigers in captivity in China. 144 of these tigers were a
                    part of the breeding and management program by the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens</p><br>
                <p>in 2005, there were only 57 South China tigers in China, and these tigers were already showing signs
                    of inbreeding, including decreased genetic diversity and low breeding success</p><br>
                <p>In 2007, one South China Tiger cub was born on a private reserve in South Africa called Laohu Valley
                    Reserve. This was the first South China Tiger to be born outside of China. As of 2016, the Laohu
                    Valley Reserve has 19 South China Tigers</p>
