                <p>The Iberian lynx is a wild cat species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula in
                    southwestern Europe. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. In the 20th century, the
                    Iberian lynx population had declined because of overhunting, poaching, fragmentation of suitable
                    habitats, and the population decline of its main prey species, the European rabbit, caused by
                    myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease.<sup><a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_lynx">1</a></sup></p><br>
                <p>By the turn of the 21st century, the Iberian lynx was on the verge of extinction, as only 94
                    individuals survived in two isolated subpopulations in Andalusia in 2002. Conservation measures have
                    been implemented since then, which included improving habitat, restocking of rabbits, translocating,
                    reintroducing and monitoring Iberian lynxes. By 2012, the population had increased to 326
                    individuals, to 855 in 2020, and to 1111 in 2021.<sup><a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_lynx">1</a></sup></p><br>
                <p>The Iberian lynx is threatened by habitat loss, road accidents, and illegal hunting. Habitat loss
                    is due mainly to infrastructure improvement, urban and resort development and tree mono cultivation,
                    which fragments the lynx's distribution. In the 20th century, rabbit diseases such as myxomatosis
                    and hemorrhagic disease resulted in a dramatic decline of its main prey. Illegal traps set for
                    rabbits and foxes were leading causes for lynx fatality in the 1990s. Every year, several
                    Iberian lynxes die when trying to cross highways with heavy traffic. In 2013, 14 Iberian lynxes
                    died on roads, and 21 in 2014.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_lynx">1</a></sup>

                <p>Many people have likely heard of Bobcats, but most people don't think of Bobcats when they hear the
                    word Lynx. A Bobcat is a type of Lynx and while it's not critically endangered like the Iberian
                    Lynx, the hunting and trading of Bobcats is closely monitored.</p>
                <p>Bobcat's are considered endangered in Ohio, Indiana, and New Jersey.</p>

                <h3>Captivity<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_lynx">1</a></sup></h3>
                <p>In 2002, the Jerez Zoo confirmed it had three females and was developing a plan for a captive
                    breeding program. One of those females was Saliega, captured as a kitten in April 2002. She
                    became the first Iberian lynx to breed in captivity, giving birth to three healthy kittens on 29
                    March 2005 at the El Acebuche Breeding Center, in the Do√±ana Nature Park in Huelva, Spain. Over
                    the following years, the number of births grew and additional breeding centers were opened. In March
                    2009, it was reported that 27 kittens had been born since the beginning of the program. In 2009,
                    the Spanish government planned to build a 5.5 million euro breeding center in Zarza de Granadilla.
