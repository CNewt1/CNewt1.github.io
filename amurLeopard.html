                <p>The Amur leopard is a leopard subspecies native to the Primorye region
                    of southeastern Russia and northern China. It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red
                    List. In 2007, only 19â€“26 wild leopards were estimated to survive in southeastern Russia and
                    northeastern China. It was considered as one of the rarest cats on Earth.<sup><a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amur_leopard">1</a></sup></p><br>
                <p>As of 2015, fewer than 60 individuals were estimated to survive in Russia and China.[4]
                    Camera-trapping surveys conducted between 2014 and 2015 revealed 92 individuals in an
                    3,242 sq mi large transboundary area along the Russian-Chinese border. In 2019, it was reported
                    that the population is close to 90 leopards.<sup><a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amur_leopard">1</a></sup></p><br>
                <p>The Amur leopard is threatened by poaching, poaching of prey species, habitat loss and deforestation
                    or exploitation of forests. Its natural habitat is threatened by forest fires and construction of
                    new roads. Due to the small number of reproducing Amur leopards in the wild, the gene pool is so
                    reduced that the population is at risk from inbreeding depression. In 2015, a wild Amur leopard
                    was found with canine distemper virus in Primorskii Krai. The small population is possibly exposed
                    to domestic or wild disease carriers and transmitters.<sup><a

                </h3><br>
                <p>The Amur leopard is poached largely for its beautiful, spotted fur. In 1999, an undercover
                    investigation team recovered a female and a male Amur leopard skin, which were being sold for $500
                    and $1,000 respectively in the village of Barabash, not far from the Kedrovaya Pad reserve in
                    Russia. Agriculture and villages surround the forests where the leopards live. As a result the
                    forests are relatively accessible, making poaching a problem not only for the leopards themselves,
                    but also for important prey species, such as roe deer, sika deer and hare, which are hunted by the
                    villagers both for food and cash.</p>
