                <p>The Asiatic Cheetah is a critically endangered subspecies of cheetah that once lived in the Arabian
                    Peninsula, the Caspian region, Trancaucasus, the Kyzylkum desert and India. Today the Asiatic
                    Cheetah can only be found in Iran.</p><br>
                <p>The Asiatic cheetah survives in protected areas in Iran where human population density is low. 84
                    Asiatic Cheetahs were sighted between December 2011 and November 2013 with 82 Cheetahs being
                    identified from camera trap photographs. As of 2017, however, only 50 Asiatic Cheetahs are estimated
                    to still be surviving in the wild.</p><br>
                <p>The Asiatic cheetah has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1996.
                    Following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, wildlife conservation was interrupted for several years.
                    Manoeuvres with armed vehicles were carried in steppes, and local people hunted cheetahs and prey
                    species unchecked. The gazelle population declined in many areas, and cheetahs retreated to remote
                    mountainous habitats.</p><br>
                <p>Reduced gazelle numbers, persecution, land-use change, habitat degradation and fragmentation, and
                    desertification contributed to the decline of the cheetah population.[22][48] The cheetah is
                    affected by loss of prey as a result of antelope hunting and overgrazing from introduced livestock.
                    Its prey was pushed out as herders entered game reserves with their herds.[38] A herder pursued a
                    female cheetah with two cubs on his motorbike, until one of the cubs was so exhausted that it
                    collapsed. He caught and kept it chained in his home for two weeks, until it was rescued by officers
                    of the Iranian Department of Environment.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>In 2014, the Iranian national football team announced that their 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 AFC
                    Asian Cup kits are imprinted with pictures of the Asiatic cheetah in order to bring attention to
                    conservation efforts. In February 2015, Iran launched a search engine, Yooz, that features a
                    cheetah as logo.</p>

                <p>In September 2001, the project "Conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah and its Associated Biota" was
                    launched by the Iranian Department of Environment in cooperation with the United Nations
                    Development Programme's Global Environment Facility, the Wildlife Conservation Society,
                    the IUCN Cat Specialist Group, the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the Iranian Cheetah Society.

                <p>A few orphaned cubs have been raised in captivity, such as Marita who died at the age of nine years
                    in 2003. Beginning in 2006, the day of his death, 30 August, became the Cheetah Conservation Day,
                    used to inform the public about conservation programs.</p>
