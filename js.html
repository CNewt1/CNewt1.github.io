            <section>
                <p>The first Javascript project I added to this site was the collapsable sidebar. I used an event
                    listener attached to an image of a "burger" stack icon to toggle the side bar between visable and
                    hidden. This was done with just Javascript and can be seen on any page of the site. But it's best
                    viewed on the <a href="index.html">home page</a></p><br>
                <p>The second Javascript project on this page is the slideshow that cycles between images of the four
                    endangered cats. This project is like the slide show from the lesson11 project, but I had to tweak
                    it to work for this page. You can view the slide show on the <a href="index.html#slideshow">home
                        page</a></p>
                <br>
                <p>The third project on this page is a pause/play function I added to the slideshow. I wanted the
                    slideshow to rotate through the images somewhat quickly, but I also wanted to give the user the
                    ability to pause on an image in the slide show. The solution I came up with was done with just
                    vanilla Javascript, but was the most difficult part of this website as every other solution I tried
                    ended up breaking something. To sample this, go click on the slideshow on the <a
                        href="index.html#slideshow">home page</a></p><br>
                <p>The fourth project on this page is a calculator to estimate the estimated number of species that have
                    gone extinct so far today. This function collects the time of day from the client, converts to a
                    numeric value, and works out how many species have gone extinct that day based on how late it is.
                    This function does not account for minutes and only estimates based on the number of whole hours
                    since midnight, rounding down. You can see this calculator <a
                        href="index.html#daily-extinction">here</a></p><br>
                <p>The fifth, and my personal favorite, project on this site is the 'return to top' button. When the
                    user scrolls down the page, an image of an up-arrow will appear towards the bottom right of their
                    window. When/if the user clicks said arrow, the page will automatically scroll all the way back to
                    the top of the page. In hindsight, this is probably the most difficult project on this sight, but I
                    was fortunate to find some good resources and everything worked out without too much headache. The
                    hompage is the only page with enough content to accurately demo this project, demo it <a
                        href="index.html">here</a></p>
